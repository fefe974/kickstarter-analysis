# kickstarter-analysis


## Overview of Project

This analysis takes a closer look at the Kickstarter dataset. We will be taking a closer look at the data
and finding how different campaigns fared concerning their launch dates and funding goals.

### Purpose

During this analysis we will be  taking a look into the dataset especifically: Theatre Outcomes by Date and, 
outcomes Based by Goals. 

### Analisys and Challenges 

Our findings based on launch dates show outcomes (successful, failed, canceled) measured by their launch dates (months).
Also, we will be taking a look at outcomes based on goals. While looking at the Launch by Date line chart, we can see that we have close to
double the number of successful plays than failed ones during most of the year (Jan, Nov). The highest successful campaigns happened
from April to September, peaking in May with 111 successful goals. Canceled launch dates remained close to 0 during the year.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

In our findings based on goals, we are looking at percentages of successful, failed, and canceled
goals based on the amount collected. Our line chart shows that the successful goals trend down, starting in goals established in less than 1000 going to 25000/29999. From 30000/34999, we can observe
the successful line setting a lower high around the 40000 mark and at 45000 starting another downtrend. Also, in our chart, we can identify the 
failed goals starting an uptrend at 1000, creating a higher high peak at 50000. A lower low can be seen around the 35000 to 40000 mark and then 
continuing its uptrend at 45000, making its highest point at this level. 



### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

In this analysis we are using qualitative (Outcomes y Launch Date) and quantitative data (Outcomes on Goals), making it compicated to find relation between the two
since qualitative data is descriptive in nature, expressed in language rather than numerical values as our Outcomes on Goals.


## Results

In our date analysis we can conclude that during the months of February, and April to August are the months that gained the most amount of successful campains. 
September through December we can observed a low amount of successful campains and a high amount of failed campains. During this months we can lowwer the amount of 
collection goals and amount of plays in theatres. To set the amount of collections to set during the year, we could use the month colums and the percentage column
to set reasonable goal amounts per month.
